# Hi there

I'm Louis Abel. I'm originally a System Administrator, turned System Engineer,
turned... I'm not sure anymore. I wear a lot of hats these days. Either way,
I want to thank you for stopping by!

## What do you work on?

I work on too many things to remember or count. The primary things I work on
though these days would be:

* [Rocky Linux](https://rockylinux.org)
* Ansible stuff (like my lazybuilder)
* My own FreeIPA adventures
* My own Fedora system when it misbehaves
* Maintaining some python and powershell scripts, Windows images (for my own 
sanity)

## What do you do in your free time?

I work on my music or I go to one of my few go-to games at my disposal, such as
StarCraft, Guilty Gear Strive, gzdoom, and Overwatch. If you would like to play
StarCraft (brood war/remastered) or Guilty Gear, I am always open! You can find
me on the US West regions.
